Online reviews have become increasingly significant in recent years when it comes to purchasing decisions. This is so that buyers can learn a lot of important information about the products or services from these reviews. Spammers, however, may fabricate and create false reviews in order to promote falsely or reduce the quality of the goods or services. Customers would be misled and make poor decisions as a result of the spammers' actions. Consequently, identifying fake (spam) reviews is a major issue.
To ensure the credibility of the reviews posted on a platform, it is important to use a strong detecting model. Our Monitoring and Deleting Fake Reviews of Online Products System is designed to save efforts and time by helping users identify spam reviews from different opinions quickly and also help in purchasing valuable products from a trustworthy site.
